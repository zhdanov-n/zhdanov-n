Thompson wrote the first PDP-11 assembly language version to help Lee E. McMahon. analyze the text of the Federalist Notes in order to determine the authorship of individual articles.
The text editor ed (also created by Thompson) had support for regular expressions, but could not be used for such a large amount of text, so Thompson extracted this code into a separate tool.
He chose this name because, in ed, the command g / re / p printed all lines that matched the given pattern.
